# Profile counter

A profile counter that updates 
that looks something like this 

<img src="https://profile-counter.deno.dev/profile-count-repo/count.svg" alt="Profile Counter Repo :: Visitor's Count" />

To add this to your readme:

```
<img src="https://profile-counter.deno.dev/:yourkey:/count.svg" alt="Key:: Visitor's Count" />
```

You may also use this as image url on your website and get this working there too 

Heavily inspired by `https://profile-counter.glitch.me/:yourkey:/count.svg`

I could not find the creator of it , you may create a PR to update 

Further disclamer it used a discord web-hook to notify me of the view ; I plan to set env variable to just whitelist my personal keys so that i only revice notifications for my projects
